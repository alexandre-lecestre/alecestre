Since September 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Research Unit [MISTEA](https://mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/), [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/centres/occitanie-montpellier), under the supervision of [Nicolas Verzelen](https://verzelen.montpellier.inrae.fr/). I am a member of the [ASCAI project](https://sites.google.com/view/prci-ascai/accueil) and I am currently working on singal detection in the context of active sensing (multi-armed bandits) with Nicolas Verzelen and [Alexandra Carpentier](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandracarpentierresearch/home).

Before that, I did my PhD at the
[University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/en/) under the supervision of [Yannick Baraud](https://math.uni.lu/baraud/Home.html), in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/research-departments/department-of-mathematics/). My [thesis](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/59847) is entitled *Robust estimation for possibly dependent observations: application to mixture and hidden Markov models*.
