During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant for courses of the [Bachelor in Mathematics](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/bachelor-in-mathematics/). I was teaching in french as it is its main language. More information about the courses can be found [here](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/bachelor-in-mathematics/programme/).
