I had the opportunity to take part in some tutoring programs during my education.

Math Forge
======
The Math Forge is a program at the University of Luxembourg which allows students (not only in mathematics) to meet with doctoral candidates, postdocs and professors in mathematics to get help to understand better the courses they follow. There were 2 sessions of 90 minutes per week.

Mentoring
======
During my first year (3rd year of BSc) in the Department of Mathematics at [ENS de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/), I was mentoring a student in their first year of undergraduate studies.
